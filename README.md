# React Native Memory Leak Demo

## Running the demo

```
yarn install
cd ios && pod install cd -
yarn ios
```

After the app gets built and started on simulator, attach the Xcode debugger to the process: Debug > Attach to process > axiousMemoryLeaksDemo.

Or just build and run the app from the Xcode right away.
